/* README for substring
*   Extract a portion of a character string. Use a function,
* substring(source, start, count, result) where:
*   source is the charcter string from which you are extracting the substring.
*   start is the index into source where the substring begins.
*   count is the number of characters to be extracted from source.
*   result is the substring.
*
* 08/09/2022 test fgets result. puts used to test fgets. Printf used with
* fgets gives me a leading blank on printing to screen.
*
* 08/09/2022 Got sub_string to work. Program works, needs testing.
*
* 08/09/2022 put parameter checks into sub_string.

* 08/16/2022
* ok, complicated situation: stripped out all the more advanced c library
* string functions. use getchar() to get a character from the console, then
* use do...while to create the string.
*
* max_length changed to 81. eighty for the string one for the \0.
*
* use puts() for message strings, but i need to study c libray string
* functions and their proper use.
*
* don't "initialize" the strings.
*
* added string length capability.
